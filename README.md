> A Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for Python-based ROS 2 launch files — improving developer experience by enabling go-to-definition, code completion, diagnostics, and more.

---

## 📌 Overview

The ROS 2 launchfile system is a powerful tool to configure and start ROS 2 nodes through Python files. It supports dynamic substitutions, argument declarations, and nested actions. However, as ROS 2 projects grow, it becomes harder to understand what arguments are being used, what executables are started, and where variables are defined. This project brings the power of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to ROS 2 launch development — enabling intelligent editor support for large-scale systems.

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Go-to-Definition         | Jump to the declaration of arguments and substitutions                      |
| ✅ Code Completion          | Suggest valid launch actions and substitution types                         |
| ✅ Find References          | Find all occurrences of an argument or variable                             |
| ✅ Executable Suggestions   | Recommend ROS 2 node executables for `Node` actions                         |
| ✅ Syntax Diagnostics       | Report invalid syntax or usage errors in launch files                       |
| 📚 Hover Docs (planned)     | Show launch action or substitution docs on hover                            |

## 🧪 Use Cases in `example.launch.py`

We’ve added rich comments inside [`test_files/example.launch.py`](./test_files/example.launch.py) to demonstrate how the LSP server handles:

- Declaring and using launch arguments with defaults
- Referencing arguments in node definitions
- Using `GroupAction` and nested launch structures
- Calling `OpaqueFunction` for dynamic content
- Incorrect substitutions (for syntax error diagnostics)
- Environment variable usage
- Including launch files and shared parameters

> 💡 These examples show the value of the LSP: code navigation, references, completions, and catching mistakes early.
